# B573 Assignment 2: Introduction to Python

## Programming Language: Python

## Date: September 15, 2023

## Description:

This repository is designed to perform manipulations such as creating the reverse complement sequence and print certain portions of a sequence obtained from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome browser. Additionally, the repository takes user input to generate a list of fibonacci numbers and two other lists derived from the first. Lastly, a matrix is created and different calculations are computed. This repository uses the programming language Python and serves as an introduction guide to the language.
### Required Files

<code>chr1_GL383518v1_alt.fa</code>  contains the sequence to be used in python scrips

<code>assignment_2.1.py</code>   outputs the 10th and 758th letter of the sequence

<code>assignment_2.2.py</code>   creates the reverse complement of the sequence and print the 79th & the 500th through the 800th letters 

<code>assignment_2.3.py</code>   generates the fibonacci sequence and associated lists of a user defined length

<code>assignment_2.4.py</code>   creates a matrix and calculates associated properties of it

<code>assignment_2.5.py</code>   generates the base totals for each kilobase of the sequence


### Required Packages

There are no specific packages required for this repository.

### Execution

<ins>Steps to Run the Script</ins>

1. Clone repository

2. Change working directory to location of files

    ```
    cd path/to/files
    ```

3. Run the scripts using the following commands: 

    ```
    python assignment_2.1.py 
    python assignment_2.2.py
    python assignment_2.3.py
    python assignment_2.4.py
    python assignment_2.5.py
    ```

4. Each script will output results in the command line.

    a. <code>assignment_2.3.py</code> will require user input into the command line.
